# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Apprentice portfolio! This repository contains my work and analysis showcasing my skills as a Data Analyst. Below is an overview of the contents and steps involved in my analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is **EU_Superstore_dataset.xls**. This dataset contains Row ID`: Unique identifier for each row.
- `Order ID`: Identifier for the order.
- `Order Date`: Date of the order placement.
- `Ship Date`: Date of order shipment.
- `Ship Mode`: Shipping mode chosen for the order.
- `Customer ID`: Identifier for the customer.
- `Customer Name`: Name of the customer.
- `Segment`: Customer segment (e.g., Corporate, Consumer, Home Office).
- `City`: City where the customer is located.
- `State`: State where the customer is located.
- `Country`: Country where the customer is located.
- `Region`: Geographic region.
- `Product ID`: Identifier for the product.
- `Category`: Product category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).
- `Sub-Category`: Sub-category of the product.
- `Product Name`: Name of the product.
- `Sales`: Total sales amount.
- `Quantity`: Quantity of products sold.
- `Discount`: Discount applied to the order.
- `Profit`: Profit earned from the order.

## Loading and Exploring Data

**EU_Superstore.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to load the dataset, perform initial data exploration, and conduct basic data quality checks. In this notebook, I performed the following steps:

   - Imported the necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
   - Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
   - Explored the first few rows of the dataset using `.head()` method.
   - Checked for missing values using `.isna()` and `.sum()` methods.
   - Calculated summary statistics using `.describe()` method.
   

## Tableau Visualizations

**dashboard_european_store** This image file showcases a visualization created in Tableau. The visualization focuses on sales by date time and country

## Conclusion

This portfolio demonstrates my skills as a Data Analyst Apprentice in terms of data loading, exploration, and basic data visualization. I have used Python and Pandas for data analysis, as well as Tableau for more advanced visualizations.

Feel free to explore the files in this repository to see my analysis process and the results I have obtained from the dataset.
